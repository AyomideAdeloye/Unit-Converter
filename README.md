# This is my first full project using Python.
# I created a unit converter that converts various measurements.
# Some measurements include but not limited to: newtons, pounds-force, kilogram-force which can be converted within each other.
# Other measurements also include celsius, fahrenheit, kelvin, etc which convert within each other as well.
# The program will ask the user to input what unit they want to convert from and to, ask to input the number and the output will be given.
